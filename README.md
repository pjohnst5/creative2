Git repo for creative project 1 CS 260

This is a creative project, so you are welcome to build what you would like. The basic requirements are:

A home page
Three or more additional pages
The site uses some images
The site uses CSS Grid or Flexbox for at least one page
The site has a form on at least one page (the form does not have to work)
A footer that lists the URL for your GitHub repository

Item	Points
Has sufficient HTML content on every page 	50
Uses images	10
Uses CSS Grid or Flexbox	10
Has a page with a form	10
Uses good web design principles	20
 

For web design principles, we will only be looking at spacing, typography, graphics, color, and consistency. We will subtract 1 point for a principle if you need some work, 2 points if you need a lot of work. This means you automatically get 10 points, and then 1 to 2 points more for each design principle.
